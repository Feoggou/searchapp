A fast search application for windows, written in C++, using pure windows API (no framework).

SearchApp is a search application for Windows Vista and Windows 7. It has been developped due to some great drawbacks of the default Windows Search of Windows Vista and Windows 7, among which:
- very long search time in non-indexed locations;
- many irrelevant results, caused by the lack of options, which harden the work of the user who tries to find what he needs in that very long list of results.

SearchApp is meant to solve all these issues: 
- it is searches quickly;
- it has all the options you need to find the files and folders you need, thus reducing the search time, especially if searching contents. 
Here, windows search searches your keywords in file contents, when you may only want to search file names.
